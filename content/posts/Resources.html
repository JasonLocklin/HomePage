<h2>Custom Search</h2>
<p> I have found that searching for technical questions has become rather difficult as 
  ai blog mills have started filling search results with useless garbage. I suggest anyone
  struggling with this create their own custom "programmable search engine" that searches
  only sites they consider good sources of information on the topics they need to search. 
  This can be done with Google <a href="https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/all">here</a>.

<p>In my own version, I have various R related community pages and blogs, plus sites like
reddit and stackexchange, as well as the roots of mailing list reflectors that have their 
  archives indexed.</p>

<p>Click <a href="https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=e400af805d50f4681#gsc.tab=0">here</a> for a 
dedicated page, or use the search below to search only a few tech sites with known human
contributors.</p>
