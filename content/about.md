Welcome! I'm a community research scientist with a passion for applying technical expertise to research problems in our communities. Since completing my PhD, I have enjoyed the opportunity to do so in both the public education system and healthcare sector. My background is rooted in a blend of rigorous technical training, expertise in data collection, advanced statistical analysis, and a focus on translating that work into data-driven decision-making or policy refinement.

Today, the core of my work is a commitment to equity, ensuring that student identity never predicts outcomes. In my current role as a Research Officer with the Waterloo Region District School Board (WRDSB), I've had the privilege of leading a variety of projects designed to assess and report on both student and staff experiences, and to use the results of that work to inform practice within the system.

Here's a glimpse into my journey and contributions:

  +  I design and implement system-level measurements aimed at bolstering educational outcomes and student well being. My approach is rooted in evidence-based practices, working hand-in-hand with administration and various stakeholders to deliver actionable insights.
  +  Strategic Collaboration: My role involves in-depth collaboration to facilitate data-driven decisions, ultimately striving to elevate program effectiveness and bolster student well-being.
  +  Leading by Research: I manage diverse research projects in collaboration with my colleagues as part of a wonderful, dynamic research team, leveraging both quantitative and qualitative methodologies to navigate complex educational challenges.
  +  I am a data nerd by trade and passion. I enjoy tackling complex data problems with the R language and other open source tools.
