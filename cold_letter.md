Dear Recruitment and Leadership,
I am a Research and Organizational Transformation leader with extensive experience developing community research both within and outside of education, providing advanced data analytics, and reporting to wide audiences, including professional learning and system support for school administrator's School Learning Improvement Plans, and business and learning services leadership of program evaluation and ministry reporting. This has included providing actionable and accessible contributions to Student Achievement Plan, Strategic Plan, Accessiblity Plan, and related organizational goals.

I am available for contract and other opportunities that could involve bringing my wealth of experience and profesionalism to any of the following:
+ School climate survey, Student Census, or other student survey implementation and analysis.
+ Student Achievement Plan data collection and preparation for ministry reporting.
+ Staff surveys (example: census and wellbeing surveys) implementation, anslysis, and reporting.
+ EQAO analysis and communication.
+ Board Accessibility, anti-ablism, or equity policy planning support, including community engagement and feedback collection.
+ Professional development feedback and program evaluation.
+ Any related work.


At the Waterloo Region District School board for the past 6 years, I have worked with team members and colleagues across the organization and leadership to move the organization toward more effective use of data and evidence toward improving student and staff success. This role has ranged from informal support, such as providing suggestions or guidance about analytical approaches or communication strategies, to leading several large projects and supporting the organization to integrate the results into board and school planning. This includes program evaluation and monitoring to help realize the board’s strategic planning process. These, and the many other smaller projects I have been involved with have been carefully managed to make efficient use of staff resources, operate thoughtfully with regard to research ethics and community needs, and mobilize knowledge for maximising organizational impact. As you will see, my qualifications and experience make me a potentially invaluable resource to lead research and organizational transformation at your board:

+ I have a Ph.D. in Psychology, Behavioural and Cognitive Neuroscience from the University of Waterloo that has been followed by 8 years of work experience across the healthcare and education sectors managing, interpreting and communicating complex initiatives and data sources of evidence for a wide array of audiences including school board leadership, school administration, physician and clinician groups, and government ministries.
+ I contribute to strategic and resource planning through monitoring of organization-wide outcomes, and contributing data products for the Board Improvement and Equity Plan / Student Achievement Plan leading to effective implementation of plans, policies and communication with various stakeholders in our organization.
+ I have a unique ability to communicate data in a way that is accessible, actionable, and engaging, by focusing on the story it tells, in a way that can only be done because of the context that comes from by background knowledge of where that data comes from, how it fits into the broader picture of the district and wider education sector, and crucially, how it is used in the boardroom and classroom.
+ Communication and relationship building are central to all of my work. My background allows me to speak the language of Information Technology, data strategies, and education research, but I also have a well developed skill of active listening that permits me to learn from and develop relationships with equity and learning professionals as well as external organizations.
+ I have a proven track record in all aspects of research, facilitating and change management, from engaging with stakeholders and administration for impactful program evaluation, data collection, interpretation, representation and communication of a wide array of data sources, including the translation of complex data sources like student socio-economic, demographic, school-climate, and roadmap to 100 “at-risk” indicators for multiple audiences.
+ I have experience in assessment and program evaluation, educational design and evaluation methodologies in the large-scale educational environment of the WRDSB, including the Safe Caring and Inclusive School Survey, the Student Equity Index, and Guarding Minds at Work. These are used to inform and assess the suitability of programs and resource allocations and involve knowledge translation that takes into account new insights from the field of education research in ways that carefully consider the needs of department and organizational leadership.
+ I have excellent interpersonal, consultation, and oral/written communication skills with a proven ability to translate complex research and statistical concepts to a variety of audiences. I demonstrated these abilities while communicating WRDSB research to staff, such as when sharing the Middle Years Development Inventory results with administrators at yearly Family of Schools meetings, and through previous work consulting with stakeholders and colleagues in the multi-professional research team associated with the Centre for Family Medicine about research projects.
+ I have demonstrated the ability to work productively and strategically through efficient resource management of projects for cost effective delivery of results. I have been tasked with the management of financial resource and budget development, forecasting and reporting for a large research grant application I completed for the Centre for Family Medicine.
+ I have nearly two decades of experience with research design, including ethics protocols and legislation, survey development, measurement and statistical analysis of quantitative and qualitative data including use of Qualtrics for data collection and reporting, PowerBI, Python, SPSS, and the “R” statistical software package for analytics and data visualisation. I have demonstrated project management and organizational skills with several ongoing products, including data sharing products for external organizations, annually updated tools like the Student Equity Index, and regular system surveys that are reported broadly across the organization.
+ I develop strong rapport across an organization by cultivating a culture of respect. Leadership and colleagues come to rely on my support, as it is always thoughtful, respectful, and I adjust to their needs. When leading team members, including colleagues or in supervising research assistants, that same respect and patience creates a productive work environment.
+ As an active part of the wider Ontario educational research community through my role as an executive of The Association of Educational Researches of Ontario, I can represent the organization well and connect with resources that can benefit initiatives and learning opportunities.

I would use this opportunity to employ what I have learned to facilitate coordination, implementation, monitoring and reporting needs for the OCDSB. I would strive to promote a spirit of inquiry among organization leaders, as well as an organizational culture of evidence-based decision making through respectful and inclusive practices, innovations, and policies, and I appreciate the opportunity to advocate for why I am the ideal candidate to continue this important work. I look forward to hearing from you.
