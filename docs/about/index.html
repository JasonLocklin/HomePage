<p>“Let the Dataset Change your Mindset” guides my approach to research and organizational transformation. I&rsquo;ve found that the most impactful research begins with curiosity - asking questions, listening to practitioners&rsquo; experiences, and truly understanding the context in which data will be used. This mindset helps bridge the gap between research and practice, connecting professional educators with the evidence and guidance that can make the difference for students.</p>
<p>But this philosophy goes deeper than just curiosity. It&rsquo;s about approaching data with both rigor and openness, allowing carefully collected and thoughtfully analyzed data to challenge our assumptions and reveal new insights. The key is asking the right questions and conducting analysis with a deep understanding of how the data is generated and used in real educational settings. When we combine methodological excellence with genuine curiosity about practitioners&rsquo; experiences, data becomes a powerful tool for positive change.</p>
<p>As a Research and Organizational Transformation leader, I combine this collaborative approach with technical expertise to improve education through evidence-based practices. Since completing my PhD in Psychology, Behavioural and Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Waterloo, I have focused on ensuring research translates into meaningful improvements for students and educators.</p>
<p>My work centers on a vision of ensuring that student identity and social location no longer predicts outcomes. I lead initiatives that enhance data-driven and equity-focused decision-making, developing projects that assess and improve student achievement while building staff capacity to use evidence effectively. This involves not just collecting and analyzing data, but transforming it into insights that can directly inform classroom practice.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how I approach this work:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I design and implement system-level measurements that align with strategic goals and enhance educational outcomes. This ranges from large-scale student surveys to predictive analytics, always with a focus on creating actionable insights for educators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I believe in making complex information accessible and meaningful. By understanding both the technical aspects of data and the realities of education, I help create narratives that connect research findings to classroom practice in ways that resonate with educators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open source tools, particularly the R programming language, are central to my approach. I teach these tools to research teams through workshops and professional development because they enable reproducible research and collaborative development. This approach ensures our work is transparent, efficient, and can be built upon by others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My technical expertise focuses on creating sophisticated yet practical data systems. By combining literate programming principles with automated workflows, I ensure analyses are both reproducible and well-documented, making them valuable resources for future work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As an executive member of the Association of Educational Researchers of Ontario, I actively engage with the broader education research community. This connection helps ensure our work reflects current best practices while contributing to the advancement of evidence-based education.</p>
<p>Through all these efforts, my goal remains constant: supporting positive change in education through thoughtful research and effective knowledge mobilization. By bringing together rigorous methodology, technical innovation, and deep respect for educator expertise, we can create sustainable improvements that benefit all students.</p>
