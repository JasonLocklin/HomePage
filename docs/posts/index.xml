      <description>Custom Search I have found that searching for technical questions has become rather difficult as ai blog mills have started filling search results with useless garbage. I suggest anyone struggling with this create their own custom &#34;programmable search engine&#34; that searches only sites they consider good sources of information on the topics they need to search. This can be done with Google here. In my own version, I have various R related community pages and blogs, plus sites like reddit and stackexchange, as well as the roots of mailing list reflectors that have their archives indexed.</description>

      <description>As a research scientist working across public education and healthcare, I rely heavily on R for its robustness and adaptability in statistical analysis and data visualization. I started working with it in my undergraduate statistics courses twenty years ago, and I have watched it develop from relative obscurity to a powerhouse of data science and rapid data analysis. I have a deep appreciation for the developers who brought this Free tool to the world of science, and am ever eager to learn more or share what I have learned.</description>
