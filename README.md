# This site is built with Hugo.

> hugo serve

Will temporarily build and serve the site locally on localhost:8080

> hugo

Will update the static files for the site to be pushed to github.
Be careful to not commit to git while "hugo serve" is running, as 
it is set up to serve temporary files from the current branch.
