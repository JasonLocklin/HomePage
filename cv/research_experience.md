## Professional Experience

* **Research Officer**, [Waterloo Region District School Board](https://www.wrdsb.ca/about-the-wrdsb/research/) \hfill  2018 to Present

  + Spearhead the development and implementation of system-level measurements aligned with WRDSB’s Strategic Plan and Board Improvement and Equity Plan, focusing on enhancing educational outcomes and operational efficiency through evidence-based practices.
  + Maintain a student demographic data tool that leverages Canadian Census data and guide senior team on using it to support WRDSB equity goals for resource allocation.
  + Collaborate with senior administrators and key stakeholders to provide actionable insights into data, facilitating data-informed decision-making to improve program effectiveness and student well-being.
  + Managed and guided several large research projects from conception through to completion, employing both quantitative and qualitative methodologies to assess and address complex educational challenges. This includes data collection using the student information system, provincial and national data, and surveys developed using the Qualtrics platform, and knowledge translation to bring the data to action in the organization.
  + Deliver a major, district-wide longitudinal student well-being research project that involves tens of thousands of students completing both a normed, standardized measurement, [the Middle Years Development Instrument](https://earlylearning.ubc.ca/monitoring-system/mdi/mdi-overview/), and locally developed questions. I produce analytics and data visualizations in the form of customized pdf reports for every school using the "R" statistical software package.
  + Lead professional development workshops for WRDSB school administrators focusing on the integration of the Middle Years Development Instrument into practical school leadership strategies and utilizing the data effectively for their School Learning And Improvement Plans.
  + Responsible for several other major projects supporting student achievement and well-being as well as the implementation of the locally delivered staff well-being "Guarding Minds at Work" survey. I manage these from the planning and data collection stages, through to qualitative and quantitative analytics, to communicating the results. Each project involves engaging in knowledge translation, and that will often involve taking into account new insights from the field of education research in a way that carefully considers the needs of department and organizational leadership.
